# This is our first machine learning program.

I recommend doing whole stuff all by yourself but if you do not have enough time, just Download the file and run with python3. Hope you understood and enjoyed programming!!

If you want to visualize your data, you need to download the "visualize.py" file, import it in your program and call the "visualize.visual()" function.
In the provided file it has already been imported and called, you just need to uncomment it!

FYI:
Underweight data points are shown by Red colour
Normal are shown by blue
Overweight are shown by green
Obese are shown by black
